We will be extensively using Tensorflow and Keras to heat and train our machine learning model.  { requirements : 6 cores, 16GB RAM, GPU Preferred} If not, you may expereience dealys in training the model.

Watch out for Pit Falls: 

What are we going to do?

Regression or Classification?

Regression : Trying to predict a real number.

Classification : Trying to assign a value to particular class. It can be binary or we may also have multiple classes.

AID to tune hyperparameters:

ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS in Neural Networks: Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, LeakyReLU, MaxOut and ELU
We wiil choose above activation functions to fire a neuron based on the data. 
Ex: Signmoid is used to predict probability as an output 
Ex: Tanh is used for classification between two classes
Ex: ReLU is most commonly used activation function in CNN's

LOSS FUNCTIONS in Neural Networks: It is also referred to as Cost function or error function, It qunatifies the error between output of the algorithma and given target value
Goal is to minimize the loss function / minimizing the errors
Ex: MSE for regression problems / MAE(mean absolute error)
Ex: Cross entropy for sigmoid related problems / Hinge loss
Ex: Svm loss
